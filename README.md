Kiss Project is a monorepo that centralize all my projects and open source projects

The idea is to keep all the things most simple as possible, simple things and stupid work better than complicate.
easy to understand as much possible from most people even low level, it's a good sign that things are good.

I know create simple things is not easy

well, starting this project with a Monorepo, because it's more simple than multi repo,
wouldn't make more sense than this project which keep in mind simplicity uses multi-repo.
